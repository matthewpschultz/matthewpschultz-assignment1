    <!--
      In this section (<body>), create a h1 tag stating your name
      Beneath that, create an unordered list with at least 3 list items
      that describe your web development experience (if any, it's ok if this is all new :D)

      This is just a quick exercise to show that you know how to work with git and GitHub
      No styling or scripting is required for this assignment

      If you don't know how to make the above mentioned tags, either take a look around on
      the internet, or don't hesitate to ask me!

    <h1>Matthew P. Schultz</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>A few years ago... OK like 15 during my first degree, I built a simple page with images of Fiona Apple. CSS and non-sucky HTML had not been
      invented yet.</li>
      <li>Have worked with a few of those simple partially built sites provided by GoDady</li>
      <li>Worked in a research lab. 4 years ago started a PHP, HTML, MySQL project for the lab. My boss decided he'd fallen in love with rails
        so we switched to that a month or two in. A lot of initial overhead in rails. Before we completed the lab moved to Philly I retired to an Admin job and forgot
        most of it. I was using git for that and am now reminded that while awesome getting it to work as expected takes a little time. And that's where I am at.</li>
